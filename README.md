# Romulus – Dark Matter Science

A modern, futuristic science site focused on exploring Dark Matter through Modified Gravity theories.

## Overview

Romulus is an educational platform exploring alternative explanations for dark matter phenomena through modified gravity theories. The project provides interactive visualizations and in-depth explanations of different theoretical frameworks that challenge the standard dark matter particle model. Our featured perspective reimagines dark matter not as discrete particles, but as a boundary condition or structural framework that defines how visible matter behaves—similar to how an artist outlines figures before filling in with color.

## The Boundary Condition Theory

What if dark matter is not a substance but rather the "outline" of the cosmic painting? This novel perspective suggests that the gravitational effects we attribute to dark matter might actually emerge from how gravity behaves at the boundaries or edges of matter concentrations. By modifying Einstein's equations with additional scalar fields or geometric terms, we can reproduce dark matter effects without requiring new particles.

This approach could explain why direct detection experiments have consistently failed to find dark matter particles despite strong indirect evidence for their gravitational effects.
