## Overview

Romulus is an educational platform exploring alternative explanations for dark matter phenomena through modified gravity theories. The project provides interactive visualizations and in-depth explanations of different theoretical frameworks that challenge the standard dark matter particle model.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Visualizations**: Space-time curvature demonstrations using Three.js and React Three Fiber
- **Theory Explorer**: Documentation hub for various modified gravity approaches
- **Mathematical Explanations**: Complex equations rendered with unicode math characters
- **Code Examples**: Sample implementations of modified gravity calculations
- **Modern Dark UI**: Sleek black background with pink neon accents

## Theories Covered

- General Relativity + Effective Tensor Modifications
- Emergent Gravity (Verlinde)
- MOND and TeVeS
- Scalar Field / f(R) Gravity
- Quantum Gravity + Holographic Principle

## Tech Stack

- Next.js with App Router
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui components
- Three.js with @react-three/fiber and @react-three/drei
- Framer Motion for animations
